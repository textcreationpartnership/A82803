            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>His Majeſties Anſwer To the DESIRES and PROPOSITIONS of both Houſes, February 3. 1642.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F His Majeſtie had not given up all the Faculties of His ſoul to an earneſt endeavour of a Peace and Reconciliation with His People, or if he would ſuffer Himſelf by any provocation to be drawn to a ſharpneſſe of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, at a time when there ſeems ſomewhat like an overture of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, He could not but reſent the heavie Charges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:132735:7"/>Him in the Preamble of theſe Propoſitions, and would not ſuffer Himſelf to be reproached with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting of Delinquents by force from Iuſtice, (His Majeſties deſire having alwayes been, that all men ſhould be tried by the known Law, and having been refuſed it) With raiſing an Armie againſt Pis Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; And to be told that Arms have been taken up againſt Him, for the defence of Religion, Laws, Liberties, Priviledges of Parliament, and for the ſitting of the Parliament in ſafetie, With many other particulars in that Preamble, ſo often, and ſo fully Anſwered by His Majeſtie, without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the World of the time and circumſtances of raiſing thoſe Arms againſt Him: When His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie was ſo far from being in a Condition to invade other mens Rights, that He was not able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and defend His own from Violence; And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out telling His good Subjects that their Religion (the true Proteſtant Religion, in which His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie was born, hath faithfully lived, and to which he will die a willing ſacrifice) their Lawes, Liberties, Priviledges and ſafety of Parliament were ſo amply ſetled and eſtabliſhed, or offered to be ſo by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie before any Army was raiſed againſt Him, and long before any raiſed by Him for His defence, that if nothing had been deſired but that Peace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection which His Subjects and their Anceſtors had in the beſt times enjoyed under His Majeſtie, or His Royall Predeceſſors, this Miſunderſtanding and Diſtance between His Majeſtie and His people, and this generall miſery and diſtraction upon the face of the whole Kingdom, had not been now the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:132735:8"/>Diſcourſe of Chriſtendom: But His Majeſtie will forbear any expreſſions of bitterneſſe, or of a ſenſe of His own ſufferings, that if it be poſſible the memory thereof may be loſt to the World; And therefore, though many of the Propoſitions preſented to His Majeſtie by both Houſes appear to him very deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory from, and deſtructive to His juſt Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and no way beneficiall to His Subjects, few of them being already due to them by the Laws eſtabliſhed; (And how unparliamentary it is by Arms to require new Laws, all the World may judge) yet (becauſe theſe may be waved or mollified, and many things that are now dark and doubtfull in them cleered and explained upon debate) His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie is pleaſed (ſuch is His ſenſe of the miſeries this Kingdom ſuffers by this unnaturall Warre, and His earneſt deſire to remove them by an happy Peace) that a ſpeedy time and place be agreed upon for the meeting of ſuch Perſons as His Majeſtie and both Houſes ſhall appoint, to diſcuſſe theſe Propoſitions, and ſuch others here following, as His Majeſtie doth propoſe to them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THat His Majeſties own Revenue, Magazine, Towns, Forts and Ships, which have been taken or kept from Him by force, be forthwith reſtored unto Him.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That whatſoever hath been done or publiſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the known Laws of the Land, or derogatory to His Majeſties Legall and known Power and Rights, be renounced and recalled, that no ſeed may remain for the like to ſpring out of for the future.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:132735:8"/>
III. That whatſoever illegall Power hath been claimed and exerciſed, by, or over His Subjects, as Impriſoning their Perſons without Law, Stopping their <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſſes,</hi> and Impoſing upon their eſtates without Act of Parliament, &amp;c. Either by both or either Houſe, or any Committee of both or either, or by any Perſons appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any of them be diſclaimed, and all ſuch Perſons ſo committed forthwith diſcharged.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That as His Majeſtie will readily conſent (having done ſo heretofore) to the execution of all Laws already made, and to any good Acts to be made for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Popery, and for the firm ſetling of the Proteſtant Religion now eſtabliſhed by Law; So He deſires that a good Bill may be framed for the better preſerving the Book of Common-Prayer from the Scorn and Violence of Browniſts, Anabaptiſts and other Sectaries, with ſuch Clauſes for the eaſe of tender Conſciences as His Majeſtie hath formerly offered.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That all ſuch perſons as upon the Treaty ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted out of the Generall Pardon ſhall be tried <hi>Per Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> according to the uſuall courſe and known Laws of the Land, and that it be left to that, either to acquit or condemn them.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And to the Intent this Treaty may not ſuffer interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by any intervening accidents, that a ceſſation of arms and free trade for all His Majeſties Subjects may be firſt agreed upon.</p>

THis offer and deſire of His Majeſtie He hopes will be ſo cheerfully entertained, that a ſpeedy and bleſſed Peace may be accompliſhed. If it ſhall be rejected, or by inſiſting upon unreaſonable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances be made impoſſible (which he hopes God in His mercy to this Nation will not ſuffer) the guilt of the Blood which will be ſhed, and the deſolation which muſt follow, will lie upon the heads of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers. However His Majeſtie is reſolved, through what Accidents ſoever He ſhall be compelled to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Rights, and with what proſperous ſucceſſe ſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to bleſſe Him, that by His earneſt conſtant Endeavours to propagate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the true Proteſtant Religion, and by His go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning according to the known Lawes of the Land, and upholding the juſt Priviledges of Parliament, according to His frequent Proteſtations made before Almighty God, which He will alwayes inviolably obſerve, the world ſhall ſee that he hath undergone all theſe difficulties and hazards for the Defence and maintenance of th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe; The zealous Preſervation of which His Majeſtie well knowes is the onely foundation and means for the true Happineſſe of Him and His people.</p>
